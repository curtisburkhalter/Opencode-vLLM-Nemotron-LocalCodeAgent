Setup: Open a project with 5-10 related files
Demo Flow:

Ask: "Analyze the architecture of this project and create a dependency diagram"
Results:
1.Will show OpenCode reading multiple files
2. Will show the generated analysis

Key advantages:

128K token context window will handle large codebases
MoE architecture: only 3B params active = fast inference (50-60tok/s)
Enterprise use case: code review, onboarding
